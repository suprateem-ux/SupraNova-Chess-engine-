# SupraNova Chess Engine

![SupraNova Logo](https://chessengines.blogspot.com/2021/09/first-test-chess-engine-supernova24.html)

**SupraNova** is a hobbyist Python-based chess engine designed to calculate approximately 30,000 nodes per second. It is optimized for analysis and integration with UCI-compatible graphical user interfaces (GUIs).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note:** `ponder=true` does **not** work reliably with `go infinite` mode, especially when paired with `stop` or `quit`. It is recommended to always use `ponder=false` for stable operation.
